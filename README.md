# fluxtream-capture-ng2

This is an ionic 2 project

To start the server in development mode, start with `npm install`
You will need to have both a fluxtream backend and info of the couchdb instance it is communicating to. You may want to edit the ngrok.yml configuration, but alternative setups are possible.

Run the server using `ionic serve`, which will use the default `8100` port on `localhost`

To add support for android and ios do `ionic platform add ios/android`

To run on android, first connect your device with an USB cable and enable USB debugging - test your configuration using `adb devices` and check that your device is connected.

App icon and splash screen are generated by doing `ionic resources --icon`, then `ionic resources --splash`, after which you will have to run the resources.cmd command on the command line.

Running the app on your android for testing is done by running `ionic run android`. The same should be valid of ios.
