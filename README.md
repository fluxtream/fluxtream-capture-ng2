# fluxtream-capture-ng2

This is an ionic 2 project

To start the server in development mode, start with `npm install`
You will need to have both a fluxtream backend and info of the couchdb instance it is communicating to. You may want to edit the ngrok.yml configuration, but alternative setups are possible. To let the app know about those references, copy `src/env/environment.sample.ts` to `src/env/environment.ts` and edit according to your setup.

Run the server using `ionic serve`, which will use the default `8100` port on `localhost`

To add support for android and ios do `ionic platform add ios/android`

To run on android, first connect your device with an USB cable and enable USB debugging - test your configuration using `adb devices` and check that your device is connected.

App icon and splash screen are generated by doing `ionic resources --icon`, then `ionic resources --splash`, after which you will have to run the `resources.cmd` bash script on the command line.

Running the app on your android for testing is done by doing `ionic run android`. The same should be valid of ios.
